# Gurobi Ready for Research

Setup:
1. Register and obtain a Gurobi [academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) (free for students).
2. Download [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) (select the latest available version for your machine).
3. Activate your Gurobi license by accessing your [User Portal > Licenses](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/login/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.gurobi.com%2Fiam%2Flicenses%2Flist%2F) page (you must login). You should be provided a key in the form "grbgetkey 253e22f3-...", copy that key and paste it into your computer's command prompt or terminal (note: you should be connected on NU wifi or via NU VPN to ensure this works).
4. Finally, download the Gurobi Python API, [gurobipy](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/), by pasting "pip install gurobipy" in your desired Python environment of your computer's command prompt or terminal.
